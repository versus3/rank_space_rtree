## Build details
The source code is built on Ubuntu 20.04 (Linux kernel 5.4.0-33-generic) with g++ 8.4.0. Compiler optimization is not used. The released executable should be run in a similar environment. Our code is implemented based on the [TPIE](https://github.com/thomasmoelhave/tpie) library which has been linked statically. Users do not need to install the TPIE library separately.


## Released files
###  ascii2stream
Convert a text-based data file to a TPIE stream file, which is required when working with the TPIE library.

**Usage:** ./ascii2stream <r|logd|logid\> input\_file output\_file

**Argv:** 

1. <r|logd|logid\>: r for H, HR, Z, LH, LHR and LZ; logd for LDZ and LDHR; logid for LIIZ and LIIHR (prepare input for different indexing algorithms: *Appendix A*) 
2. input\_file: text-based input data file. In an input data file, each line contains the bounding range (four float type numbers) and the ID (a unique integer) of an object, i.e., (x\_lo, y\_lo, x\_hi, y\_hi, ID).
3. output_file: TPIE stream data file


### buildtree
Build an R-Tree from a TPIE stream file. After index building, the index tree will be dumped into files (named as \${input\_stream}.\${tree\_type}.\${blk}) on the hard disk.

**Usage:** ./buildtree input\_stream fanout <H|HR|Z|LH|LHR|LZ|LDZ|LDHR|LIIZ|LIIHR\>

**Argv:**

1. input\_stream: TPIE stream data file
2. fanout: the fanout of the built R-tree
3. <H|HR|Z|LH|LHR|LZ|LDZ|LDHR|LIIZ|LIIHR\>: tree type -- see *Appendix A*.


### testrtree
Load an index file and run queries/insertions/deletions on the index.

**Usage:** ./testrtree index\_stream <H|HR|Z|LH|LHR|LZ|LDZ|LDHR|LIIZ|LIIHR\> <query|insert|delete\> file 
	
**Argv:**

1. index\_stream: tree index file
2. <H|HR|Z|LH|LHR|LZ|LDZ|LDHR|LIIZ|LIIHR\>: tree type -- see *Appendix A*.
3. <query|insert|delete\>: type of test operations
4.  file: file for the test data. For example, for insertions, this parameter specifies the file that contains the new spatial objects to be inserted.  


### data files
We provide the following sample datasets:

1. *dataset\_uniform\_1m*: a uniform dataset with 1 million spatial objects
2. *dataset\_skew\_9\_1m*: a skewed (alpha=9) dataset with 1 million spatial objects
3. *insert\_uniform\_0.2m*: a uniform dataset with 0.2 million spatial objects for insertion
4. *insert\_skew\_9\_0.2m*: a skewed (alpha=9) dataset with 0.2 million spatial objects for insertion
5. *delete\_uniform\_0.1m*: a uniform dataset with 0.1 million spatial objects for deletion
6. *delete\_skew\_9\_0.1m*: a skewed (alpha=9) dataset with 0.1 million spatial objects for deletion
7. *query\_rects\_uniform\_10*: uniform rectangle range queries with sizes being 0.1% of the data space
8. *query\_rects\_uniform\_1*: uniform rectangle range queries with sizes being 0.01% of the data space

In dataset\_\*, insert\_\* and delete\_\* files, each line represents a spatial object as <x\_lo, y\_lo, x\_hi, y\_hi, id\>. In query\_\* files, each line contains one MBR, which is described as <x\_lo, y\_lo, x\_hi, y\_hi\>. Note that, spatial objects in deletion files do not necessarily exist in the index. 


## Examples
We first use *ascii2stream* to convert a text-based data file into a TPIE steam file. Only the data files that are used in index building require this conversion. After that, we can build the index from the TPIE steam data file and write index back into a file onto the hard disk. Then, we can run queries and updates on the built index, e.g., range queries, insertions and deletions. Insertions and deletions are executed in place, i.e., the index file will be modified. We give examples using Hilbert curves. 


### Convert text-based file to stream file
Create stream file for 'r' trees ('r' for H HR HZ LH LHR LZ. See *ascii2stream* usage above).
> ./ascii2stream r dataset\_uniform\_1m stream\_uniform\_1m

Create stream file for 'logd' trees.
> ./ascii2stream logd dataset\_uniform\_1m stream\_uniform\_1m\_logd

Create stream file for 'logid' trees.
> ./ascii2stream logid dataset\_uniform\_1m stream\_uniform\_1m\_logid


### Index building
Build a *HilbertRank-RTree (HR)* on data *stream\_uniform\_1m*, and its corresponding index structure is stored in *stream\_uniform\_1m.hrrtree.blk* and *stream\_uniform\_1m.hrrtree.info*. Note that its fanout (102) is calculated in advance. The hard disk assumes 4096-byte sectors and we use 40 bytes for each entry in a tree node, so the maximum fanout of a node is 102 (ref. Section 6.1 in [1]). An input fanout larger than the maximum fanout allowed will be replaced by the maximum fanout.
> ./buildtree stream\_uniform\_1m 102 HR

Build a *Hilbert-RTree (H)* on data *stream\_uniform\_1m*.
> ./buildtree stream\_uniform\_1m 102 H

Build a *LogR-Tree with Hilbert curve on rank space* on *stream_uniform_1m_logd* (update improved index, see paper [2]). 
> ./buildtree stream\_uniform\_1m\_logd 85 LDHR

Build a *LogR\*-Tree with Hilbert curve on rank space* on *stream_uniform_1m_logid* (update improved index, see paper [2]).
> ./buildtree stream\_uniform\_1m\_logid 72 LIIHR


### Range queries
Run range queries on HR, H, LDHR and LIIHR indices respectively.
> ./testrtree stream\_uniform\_1m.hrrtree HR query query\_rects\_uniform\_10 <br>
> ./testrtree stream\_uniform\_1m.hrtree H query query\_rects\_uniform\_10 <br>
> ./testrtree stream\_uniform\_1m\_logd.ldhrrtree LDHR query query\_rects\_uniform\_10 <br>
> ./testrtree stream\_uniform\_1m\_logid.liihrrtree LIIHR query query\_rects\_uniform\_10 <br>

### Insertions 
Insert spatial objects stored in *insert\_uniform\_0.2m* into existing indices respectively. After insertions, we can run range queries on the indices as well.
> ./testrtree stream\_uniform\_1m.hrrtree HR insert insert\_uniform\_0.2m <br>
> ./testrtree stream\_uniform\_1m.hrtree H insert insert\_uniform\_0.2m <br>
> ./testrtree stream\_uniform\_1m\_logd.ldhrrtree LDHR insert insert\_uniform\_0.2m <br>
> ./testrtree stream\_uniform\_1m\_logid.liihrrtree LIIHR insert insert\_uniform\_0.2m <br>


### Deletions
Delete spatial objects stored in *delete\_uniform\_0.1m* from existing indices respectively. After deletions, we can run range queries on the indices as well.
> ./testrtree stream\_uniform\_1m.hrrtree HR delete delete\_uniform\_0.1m <br>
> ./testrtree stream\_uniform\_1m.hrtree H delete delete\_uniform\_0.1m <br>
> ./testrtree stream\_uniform\_1m\_logd.ldhrrtree LDHR delete delete\_uniform\_0.1m <br>
> ./testrtree stream\_uniform\_1m\_logid.liihrrtree LIIHR delete delete\_uniform\_0.1m <br>


**Outputs:** Every executable file outputs 'Time' and 'Total IO' to the terminal, where 'Time' indicates the running time (in seconds) of the whole process and 'Total IO' indicates the sum of read and write I/Os. The range queries also output the number of spatial objects that are overlapped with the query rectangles.

**Example:** Here, we give an example output of range queries. We execute range queries on *stream\_uniform\_1m.hrrtree*. Range queries are executed based on the rectangle MBRs provided in file *query\_rects\_uniform\_10*. After all queries are run, we output the results to the terminal. 'Time' and 'Total IO' indicate the running time and the sum of read and write I/Os respectively. 'Total output' shows the number of spatial objects that satisfy the query predicate.

## Appendix
### Appendix A:  Index type abbreviation
| Abbr. | Index type | Appears in |
|--|--|--|
| H | R-Tree + Hilbert curve | [1] |
| HR | R-Tree + Hilbert curve + rank space | [1] |
| Z | R-Tree + Z curve + rank space | [1] |
| LH | LR-Tree + Hilbert curve | [1,2] |
| LHR | LR-Tree + Hilbert curve + rank space | [1,2] |
| LZ | LR-Tree + Z curve + rank space | [1,2] |
| LDHR | LogR-Tree + Hilbert curve + rank space | [1,2] |
| LDZ | LogR-Tree + Z curve + rank space | [1,2] |
| LIIHR | LogR\*-Tree + Hilbert curve + rank space | [1,2] |
| LIIZ | LogR\*-Tree + Z curve + rank space | [1,2] |

H, HR and Z are studied in [Ref. 1] to evaluate the effectiveness of rank space on spatial indices. Further, we apply the logarithmic structure to rank space-based spatial indices [Ref. 2], which correspond to tree types starting with letter 'L'. More details about the LR-Tree, LogR-Tree and LogR\*Tree can be found in [Ref. 2].
